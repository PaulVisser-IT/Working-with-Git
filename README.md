# Working with Git
I followed the Udemy.com course [Rocking Git & GitHub - A Real World Guide](https://www.udemy.com/share/105C9A3@gLP3Nuk-gy2PCFyxE0c-voHk3oAayB8tQa7ZPnw168DHBQfOhnxrJ1-BP-ZhCe0M "Udemy course") by Rajdeep Saha to learn Git.

## What is Git
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

## What have I learned
* I have Learned the Git fundamentals like repositories, branching, merging, commits, fetch, pull.
* I mastered the following: pull request, fork, clone, GitHub issues, labels, code review.
* I Understand advanced Git concepts like rebase, rewriting history, rolling back changes with revert, reset, squash merge and cherry picking.
